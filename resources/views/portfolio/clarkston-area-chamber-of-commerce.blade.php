        <p class="section-description">In 2015, Crandell Design redesigned the logo for Clarkston Area Chamber of Commerce and additionally created supplementary logos for the various programs and events that the chamber offers.</p>

                <p class="testimonial"><strong>&ldquo;</strong>The Chamber worked with Crandell Design to do a complete logo redesign. We were looking for a more up-to-date look and were able to achieve just that by working with Matt. Matt also worked to update and create an umbrella look for several of the Chamber event logos. He was so easy to work with and was extremely responsive and receptive during the entire development process. Due to Mattâ€™s attentiveness and persistence we were able to complete the entire project in just a few short months. He also went above and beyond to make sure that we had all of the standard logo sizing for social media. The service provided by Crandell Design was exceptional, and it was a pleasure working with Matt throughout the process.<strong>&rdquo;</strong></p>
