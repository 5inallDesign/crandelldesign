                <p>Nobody uses a phone book anymore, they use Google. So you better make sure Google can find you. That's where Crandell Design comes in. While we can't guarantee that you will automatically be number one in all of the listings (nobody can), we will help you get as high as we can so people can find you.</p>
                <p>Don't resort to using the paid listings if you don't have to as these don't always equal visits to your site. We will use key words and other inexpensive methods to get your listing moved up so you get the best bang for your buck.</p>
